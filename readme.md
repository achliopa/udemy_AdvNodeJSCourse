# Udemy Course - NodeJS:Advanced Concepts

* [Course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-node-for-developers/learn/v4/overview)
* [Repository]()

## Section 1 - The Internals of Node

### Lecture 2 - Starting with Node Internals

* our program runs on node.js 
* node.js runs on V8 engine (JS) written by Google. this engine  runs JS code outside of the browser. it run also on libuv project. a c++ project that gives access to the OS FS and other resources (network, threads)
* our application code is 100% JS, Node JS is 50% JS and 50% C++. V8 engine is 30% JS and 70% C++, libuv is 100% C++
* Node provides a JS api to the app so that we dont have to write C++ to access the base layer
* Node also provides wrappers or builtin modules or  standard libs (http, crypto, path, fs)

### Lecture 3 - Module Implementations

* to dig into the sc we wiil
	* pick a function in Node std lib
	* find where its implemented in Node sc
	* See how V8 and libuv are used to implement that function
* we chose pbkdf2 function from crypto lib. it takes a password a salt and other options and returns a hash
* we visit [NodeJS github repo](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
* lib folder contains builtin libraries (JS code)
* src folder contains C++ implementation. this is where node.js calls V8 engine and libuv
* pbkdf2 JS implementation is in /lib/internal/crypto/pbkdf2.js
* in its JS function declaration it calls _pbkdf2 (JS in same file in lib) which in turn calls PBKDF2 with same args . this is the actual function that does the hashing. it is implemented in C++ and resides in src
* this function is imported as 
```
const { INT_MAX, pbkdf2: _pbkdf2 } = process.binding('crypto');
```
* this is an unusual import. it is how node binds js with c++. th flow is: JS app code => node's JS side (lib folder in Node repo) => process.binding(): connects JS and C++ functions => V8: converts values between JS and C++ world => node c++ side (src folder in node repo) => libuv: gives node easy access to underlying OS

### Lecture 4 - Node backed by C++ ! 

* we look for PBKDF2 implementation in /src/node_crypto.cc
* in the bottom we find the C++ export 
```
env->SetMethod(target, "pbkdf2", PBKDF2);
```
* the actual implementation resides inthe same file
```
inline void PBKDF2(const FunctionCallbackInfo<Value>& args) {
  auto rv = args.GetReturnValue();
  Environment* env = Environment::GetCurrent(args);
  ...
}
```
* we see that C++ implementation uses a lot of v8 methods
```
using v8::Array;
using v8::Boolean;
using v8::Context;
```
* these are C++ implementation of JS concepts
* libuv is also used as uv_
```
static uv_once_t init_once = UV_ONCE_INIT;
  uv_once(&init_once, InitCryptoOnce);
```
